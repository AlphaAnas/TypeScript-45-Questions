// Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a array called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.
var myArray = ["Hussain", "Basil", "Abdul Rafay", "Uzair"];
for (var i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
    console.log(myArray[i], "\n");
}
// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
